## Future Works:
We will start by looking at the games in the 2009-2018 NFL season. Then, we will move onto looking at the player statistics in order to understand the players in the season. We will also look at the plays of the NFL season and finally, build a data visualization project where we will be visualizing the American Football Field and players on top of it.

In this project, We have loaded, explored, cleaned and modelled the data in order to anticipate the play type of the Football team named - 'Cleveland Browns' . Following that, We have checked if any adjustments can be made to fine-tune our best model.
